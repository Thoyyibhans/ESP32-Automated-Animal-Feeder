|  1  | ESP32 DevKitC V4          | The main microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.                               |
|  1  | HX711 Module              | A 24-bit ADC for amplifying the signal from the load cell.                               |
|  1  | Load Cell (e.g., 5kg)     | A transducer that converts force (weight) into an electrical signal. Choose a capacity appropriate for your feed hopper. |
|  1  | SG92R Servo Motor         | A small, powerful servo to open and close the feed gate. Metal gear (MG90S) is a good alternative for durability. |
|  1  | DS3231 RTC Module         | A high-precision Real-Time Clock to keep track of time even when the ESP32 is powered off. |
|  1  | WS2812B RGB LED Strip     | A strip of individually addressable LEDs for status indication (a few LEDs are sufficient).|
|  1  | 5V Power Supply           | A reliable power source (e.g., 2A USB adapter) to power the ESP32 and peripherals.       |
|  -  | Jumper Wires              | For making connections between the ESP32 and modules.                                    |
|  -  | Breadboard (Optional)     | For prototyping the circuit before final soldering.                                      |
|  -  | 3D Printed/Custom Housing | A custom-built enclosure to house the electronics and mount the feeder mechanism.        |
